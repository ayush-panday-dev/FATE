# Turbo Dynamic HTML 🚀

**Ultra-fast JavaScript template engine for dynamic HTML generation**

A lightweight, high-performance template engine built for speed and efficiency. Turbo Dynamic HTML is designed to outperform existing template engines with its optimized architecture, file-based routing system, and efficient rendering capabilities.

> ⚠️ **Early Development Warning**  
> This project is in **very early development** and requires significant fine-tuning and optimization. The API may change, features are incomplete, and it's not recommended for production use yet. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## 🌟 Features

- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Optimized for maximum performance with raw TypeScript/JavaScript
- **📁 File-based Routing**: Automatic route generation based on file structure
- **🎨 Layout System**: Nested layout support with automatic composition
- **💾 Built-in Caching**: Optional Redis caching for production environments (WIP)
- **🔧 TypeScript First**: Written in TypeScript with full type safety
- **🪶 Zero Dependencies**: Minimal footprint with no external runtime dependencies
- **🔄 Dynamic/Static Pages**: Support for both dynamic and static page generation
- **🌐 Flexible Architecture**: Works with any Node.js framework or runtime

## 🚧 Development Status

This template engine is currently in **alpha stage** with the following limitations:

- [ ] **Performance optimizations needed** - Core rendering can be significantly improved
- [ ] **Error handling incomplete** - Missing comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] **Documentation gaps** - API documentation needs expansion
- [ ] **Testing coverage low** - Comprehensive test suite required
- [ ] **Cache implementation** - Redis caching needs refinement
- [ ] **Route optimization** - File-based routing can be more efficient
- [ ] **Memory management** - Layout composition needs optimization
- [ ] **TypeScript refinement** - Type definitions need improvement

## 📦 Installation
